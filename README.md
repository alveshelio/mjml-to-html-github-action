# Convert MJML templates to HTML templates

This action will take an `input` (root of your MJML templates) and `output` (root of your HTML templates)

## How does it work?

You simply provide the root source of your MJML templates to `input` and the output for your HTML templates, and it will go through your directories and subdirectories, grab all the `.mjml` files and convert them into `.html` files following the same directory structure
